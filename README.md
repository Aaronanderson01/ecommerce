eCommerce Project - Day 1
=================

# Objectives

The purpose of this application is to build a simple backend using Node, Express, and MongoDB (via MongoJS) and connect it to a simple front-end Angular application.

During this project, you will solidify your understanding of the MongoDB API.  You will also be able to see how the database fits into the bigger picture of a full application.


## Resources

* [MongoDB Docs] (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/)


## The Domain

Most companies sell some sort of product and service. For this project we will simulate buidling an eCommerce application.  We will build this project over the course of the next three days.

Today we are going to set up our Node application, set up a basic API, add functionality to do CRUD actions with products, and create a simple front-end interface to be able to create, read, update, and delete products.

## Begin

### Step 1: Set up Node app

Set up your Node app. For this project, use MongoJS to work with MongoDB. Feel free to use any other modules or libraries that you feel will help.

**Breakpoint**: You should be able to initialize your application and connect to MongoDB without errors.

### Step 2: Create Node API

Create endpoints to create, read, update, and delete products.  Feel free to refer back to the mini-project from earlier today.  It will be a very similar process

**Breakpoint**: You should be able to hit each of your endpoints without error, and see any parameters or queries that you're sending along the way.  Check with `console.log` in your endpoint handlers.

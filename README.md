eCommerce Project
=================


### Objective



####

Build a backend using Node, Express, Massive, and SQL and connect it to a front-end Angular application

During this project, you will solidify your understanding of the Massive API.  You will also be able to see how the database fits into the bigger picture of a full application. 

Most companies sell some sort of product and service. For this project we will simulate building an eCommerce application.  We will build this project over the course of the next three weeks. This could be a major portfolio piece going forward so work hard to make this a well designed app.

eCommerce Project
=================


### Objective



####

Build a backend using Node, Express, Massive, and SQL and connect it to a front-end Angular application

During this project, you will solidify your understanding of the Massive API.  You will also be able to see how the database fits into the bigger picture of a full application. 

Most companies sell some sort of product and service. For this project we will simulate building an eCommerce application.  We will build this project over the course of the next three weeks. This could be a major portfolio piece going forward so work hard to make this a well designed app.


****


### [Day One](/part-one.md)

On day one, we will set up our Node application, set up a basic API, add functionality to do CRUD actions with products, and create a front-end interface to be able to create, read, update, and delete products.

### [Day Two](/part-two.md)

On day two, we'll continue building the eCommerce application. We will add SQL as a database using Massive.  We will be creating a Product table and replacing the current product functionality with our SQL database.

### [Day Three](/part-three.md)

On day three, we are going to create two new tables, one for Orders and one for Users.  We are also going to create a relationship between Orders and Users using a foreign key.
